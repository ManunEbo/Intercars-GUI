<h1>Intercars application GUI</h1>
<p>
Intercars Leicester doesn't have IT technicians employed. So for them to interact with the database,<br>
requires a easy to use tool.<br><br>

This project is the second part of the discontinued InterCars Leicester database application.<br>
The aim of this project was to develop a graphical user interface (GUI) that will enable<br>
Intercars staff to interact with the database without the technical knowledge.<br><br>

Inside is the incomplete development process of a desktop front end application using python kivy and kivymd that<br>
would have allowed InterCars staff to insert valuable operational information to the database and to retrieve<br>
such information in various ways for insight and decision making.<br>
